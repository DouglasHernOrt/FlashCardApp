FlashCard quiz app using Flutter
Made for Mobile App Development 2024 @ GSU
Collaborated with Khairul Anam on this project (need to ask for permission for contacts)

This is a Flash card app that uses the sqflite package for flutter to store flashcard data locally.
Users can create flashcards with questions and four answer choices (with selectable correct answer choice)
Users can edit view and delete these flash cards to study
Then users can take a quiz based on these flash cards questions, answer order and question order is randomized. Score is tallied at the end of the quiz
